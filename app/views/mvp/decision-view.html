  <p >The tribunal have considered all the information submitted by you and DWP. </p>
  <p>Their view is that you’re entitled to PIP at the rate below from 3 October 2017 until 3 March 2020.

  <p>This is the same DWP initially awarded you. </p>
  <p>If both you and DWP accept this view, you’ll be awarded PIP at the above rate. </p>
</div>
<h2 class="heading-medium">The reasons for the tribunal’s view</h2>
<p>We considered all the evidence you and DWP submitted in relation to your appeal. This includes any additional evidence you submitted.</p>

<p>After considering this evidence we acknowledge that you experience pain in your lower back when doing some tasks around the house. Specifically washing yourself and preparing food. We consider that this pain does not hinder you enough to be awarded the enhanced rate of the daily living component of PIP. </p>

<p>You claim that suffer pain while walking and you find it hard to plan a route, but in your written submission you also said you were going regularly to the GPs at the time of DWP’s decision. You also stated that you made your own way there without the assistance of aids. It is therefore our view that you are not eligible for the Mobility aspect of PIP at any rate.
