			<p>Dear Manish Sharma</p> 
			<p>You have submitted your appeal using the new ‘Appeal a benefit decision’ online service. This is one part of the work being done to improve the benefit appeals service. </p>

<p>Next we want to try and resolve some appeals online, potentially avoiding the need for a face to face hearing. We are looking for people who are in the appeals process to help us test it. </p>

<p>If you agree to take part in the test, your appeal would be reviewed early by a tribunal panel made up of a judge, doctor and disability expert. They are separate from DWP. You might have to answer some questions online about your appeal. You will not lose your right to go to a hearing, if you still want one.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">What you need to do next </h2>
<p>Please respond to this email stating whether you want to take part in the test. You will then be given further information on what happens next. </p>
