			<p>Dear Manish Sharma</p> 
			<p>DWP has responded to your PIP benefit appeal. They should have sent you a copy of their response in the post.

<h2 class="heading-medium">What happens next</h2>
A tribunal panel made up of a judge, a doctor and a disability expert will look at your appeal and decide how to proceed. They are separate to DWP. They may ask you some additional questions so make sure you keep an eye on your emails. You’ll receive an email telling you how they want to proceed by 10 October 2017

<h2 class="heading-medium">Evidence to support your appeal</h2>
Now that DWP has responded you may have some comments you want to send to the tribunal. You can email them to: benefitappeals@hmcts.net

Make sure it’s clearly marked with your appeal reference number: SC242/16/03435</p>
