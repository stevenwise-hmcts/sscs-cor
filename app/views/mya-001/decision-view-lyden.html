       The tribunal’s view on your appeal

 <div class="panel-blue">
  <p >The tribunal have considered all the information submitted by you and DWP. </p>
  <p>Their view is that you’re entitled to PIP at the rate below from 4 April 2018 until 7 February 2022.

  <p>This is more than DWP initially awarded you. </p>
  <p>If both you and DWP accept this view, you’ll be awarded PIP at the above rate.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="heading-medium">The reasons for the tribunal’s view</h2>
<p>We considered all the evidence you and DWP submitted in relation to your appeal. </p>

<p>We agreed that your ability to walk is more limited than in the decision under appeal. This is because of a combination of your back pain, obesity and heart problems. For this reason we have increased the award for the mobility component to the enhanced rate.</p>

<p>We also agree that you have greater difficulties getting in and out of the bath. Accordingly we have increased the points awarded for this activity, but this does not affect the level of the award of this component.
