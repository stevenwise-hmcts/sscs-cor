    <p class="lede">You can appoint someone as a ‘representative’ to help you with your benefit appeal. </p>

<p>A representative can:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
<li>help you submit your appeal or prepare evidence</li>
<li>act on your behalf during the appeal (they should ask your permission first)</li> 
<li>give you advice</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone can be a representative, including friends and family. A good representative will know about the benefits system and can advise you on the law. </p>

<p>You can find representatives at your local advice centre, law centre or <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/">Citizens Advice.</a></p>
