        <p class="lede">Your hearing is an opportunity to explain your benefit appeal. An independent panel of people will consider everything you tell them and make an impartial decision on your appeal. The tribunal panel are independent from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).</p>

        <p>An ESA hearing with a judge and a medical expert. There will also be a disability expert present in PIP hearings. </p>
        <h2 class="heading-medium">When you arrive </h2>
        <p>You’ll be greeted by a tribunal clerk. They’ll take care of you at the hearing venue and answer any questions you have. You should arrive at least 15 minutes before your hearing is due to start.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-medium">The hearing room </h2>
        <p>The tribunal clerk will take you into the hearing room. The tribunal panel will be sat behind a table. You’ll be invited to sit opposite them. If you have someone to support you or to give evidence, they’ll sit next to you.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-medium">The people at your hearing </h2>
        <p>The tribunal panel is made up of 2 or 3 people who’ll make a decision on your appeal. A judge and a medical expert are present in Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) hearings. There will also be a disability expert in Personal Independence Payment (PIP) appeals. They are all independent from DWP.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-medium">DWP </h2>
        <p>A representative from DWP might be there. They are not part of the tribunal panel and are there to speak on behalf of  DWP. They won’t be the person who made the decision about your entitlement to benefits.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-medium">During your hearing </h2>
        <p>The tribunal panel members will ask you some straightforward questions. They’re trying to understand how your condition affects your life. This is your opportunity to explain your side of the appeal. They will listen to everything you tell them.  </p>
        <p>Sometimes the tribunal panel will need more evidence to help them make a decision. It’s important that you submit all your evidence well before the hearing so they have time to review it. Otherwise they may have to postpone the hearing to a different day. </p>
        <h2 class="heading-medium">Getting a decision</h2>
        <p>After you’ve answered all the questions you’ll be asked to wait outside while the tribunal panel discusses your appeal. You’ll then be asked back into the room to be told the decision.</p>
        <p>The judge will explain whether you’re entitled to the benefit you are appealing for, and if so, at what level.  </p>
        <p>Sometimes the tribunal may need more time to make a decision. If that happens the decision about your appeal will be posted to you.</p>
        <p>The whole hearing usually lasts about an hour.</p>
