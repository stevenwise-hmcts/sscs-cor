       <p>Welcome to your online benefit appeal. My name is Verity Jones and I am a tribunal judge. </p>

<p>A tribunal panel made up of a judge, a doctor and a disability expert will decide your appeal. They are separate from DWP and will make an impartial decision on your entitlement to benefits. </p>

<p>The tribunal have reviewed the information that you and DWP have sent and need some more information from you. Their questions will be straightforward and answering them may mean your appeal can be decided online. </p>

<p>You can continue to see their questions after this video ends.</p>
